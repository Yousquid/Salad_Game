# 🌱 Revegetation Prototype (Name TBD)

> *"You are not a hero. You are a vegetable."*  
> An experimental game prototype exploring **cruciality** — the inevitability.

---

## 🪴 Overview

**Revegetation Prototype** is a small indie exploration built with Unity.  
The player takes the role of a sentient vegetable, aware of its fate: to be chopped, seasoned, and served as salad.  
Through movement and interaction, the game reflects on *cruciality* — the idea that some outcomes cannot be escaped, only understood.

The project is inspired by **_Salad President_**, blending minimal parkour mechanics with unsettling calmness and dark humor.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Third-person control — move, jump, and explore surreal landscapes made of kitchen-like terrains.  
- Parkour-based traversal with light physics interactions.  
- Environmental storytelling that leads the player toward their inevitable purpose.  
- A short but symbolic experience — part parody, part meditation.
